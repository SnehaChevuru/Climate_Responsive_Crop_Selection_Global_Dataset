# Climate_Responsive_Crop_Selection_Global_Dataset

This repository contains a newly developed global dataset of climate-responsive crop varieties and sowing dates for six major crops: maize, soybean, winter wheat, spring wheat, rice (season 1), and rice (season 2). The dataset is designed to support research on crop adaptation, food security, and climate impact assessment.

**Dataset Overview**

**Spatial coverage:** Global (excluding Greenland)

**Resolution:** 0.5° × 0.5° grid (~64,055 grid cells)

**Temporal coverage:** 1961–2100

**Time slices:** Seven 20-year periods (1961–1980, 1981-2000, 2001-2020, 2021-2040, 2041-2060, 2061-2080 and 2081–2100) 

**Crops included:**
Maize,
Soybean,
Winter wheat,
Spring wheat,
Rice1 (season 1) and
Rice2 (season 2)

**Cultivars/ Crop varieties included**

Maize: 7 cultivars (mag2, mag3, mag4, mag5, mag6, mag7, mag8)

Soybean: 7 cultivars (soy1, soy2, soy3, soy4, soy5, soy6, soy7)

Winterwheat: 9 cultivars (wwh1, wwh2, wwh3, wwh4, wwh5, wwh6, wwh7, wwh8, wwh9)

Springwheat: 9 cultivars (swh1, swh2, swh3, swh4, swh5, swh6, swh7, swh8, swh9)

Rice1 and Rice2: 9 cultivars (rice1, rice2, rice3, rice4, rice5, rice6, rice7, rice8, rice9)

**Conditions:** Irrigated and Rainfed

**Data format:** .txt files (one per crop, per time slice)

Each file includes recommended sowing dates and selected crop varieties under evolving climate conditions, as simulated using the WOFOST model and climate scenario data.

**Repository Contents**

data/ — Contains two zip folder (Irrigated.zip and Rainfed.zip). Each zip folder has crop-specific TXT files for each time slice 

crop_variety/ - Contains crop-specific variety/cultivar infomration  

metadata/ — Documentation of variables, file structure, and example records

README.md — This file
